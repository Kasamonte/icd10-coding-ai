# icd10-coding-ai
An advanced transformer-based AI model designed for automated ICD-10 medical coding, improving efficiency, accuracy, and scalability in healthcare billing systems.

## Overview
This project leverages deep learning to automate the process of assigning ICD-10 codes to clinical text. It uses a transformer-based architecture, offering robust solutions for medical billing and coding automation.

## Features
- Automatically assigns ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS codes.
- Built with transformer architecture for NLP tasks.
- Customizable for specific datasets and use cases.
- Integration-ready for real-time hospital systems.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [your-repo-link]
   cd icd10-coding-ai
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
		pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Set up your OpenAI API key: Add your API key to a .env file**:
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
4. **Run the demo: Test the model with sample clinical text by running**:
   ```bash
   python demo_gpt.py

### **Why This Works**
1. **Blank Lines**: There’s a blank line before and after every code block to ensure Markdown parses it as a proper block.
2. **Indentation**: The text and code are indented consistently under the list numbers, ensuring proper alignment.
3. **Triple Backticks (` ``` `)**: These correctly mark multi-line code blocks.

### **How to Fix in GitHub**
1. Open your README file in edit mode.
2. Replace the "Installation" section with the corrected Markdown above.
3. Click **Preview** to confirm that:
   - All numbers (`1.`, `2.`, etc.) are the same color.
   - Code blocks appear in gray boxes.
4. Click **Commit changes** to save.

Let me know if it still doesn’t render correctly!
